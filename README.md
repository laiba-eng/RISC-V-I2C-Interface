# RISCV-I2C-Interface
This project implements an I2C communication protocol using memory-mapped I/O with single-cycle RISC-V. A structured FSM enables master/slave data transfer with features like start/stop conditions, acknowledgments, and clock stretching. Performance metrics such as maximum clock frequency, data transfer rate, and system efficiency were analyzed.
